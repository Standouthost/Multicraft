 Made the BlockType parameter optional for /cuboid and /ellipsoid. Now it takes blocktype of the second click (or last-previously-used-blocktype when using /mark) in the absence of the optional parameter.
 ConfigTool: Added a new tab for IRC setting.
 ConfigTool: Fixed a bug that prevented  the last 2 checkboxes on the permission list from being saved properly.

 IRC: Fixed a bug with infinite reconnects on receiving error 433 Nickname already in use.
 Zones: Changed behavior of overlapping zones:
  - Before: To touch a block, AT LEAST ONE zone has to allow it
  - Now: To touch a block, ALL ZONES have to allow it
 Zones: Added /ztest command that lists all zones affecting a particular block. It can be used to detect and resolve zone overlaps.
 Zones: Added proper /help entries for /zone, /zones, /zremove, and /ztest, and contextual help for /zone and /zones.
 Zones: Made zone commands inaccessible from console (it would cause a crash, since zones are world-specific).
 Fixed OnPlayerDisconnected and OnPlayerListChanged sometimes firing at the wrong time.
 Added better error handling to Map.Save() in case the target file is not writable.
 Updated /help entries for /lock, /unlock, and /load commands.


0.404

 Fixed worlds being unloaded before all block updates are processed (thus aborting draw commands).
 Fixed several potential multiworld-related crashes and freezes.
 Made Server.UnregisterPlayer check ALL worlds to remove the player, not just most recent one.
 IRC: Added an information message to notify users of the IRC Bot's online status when joining the server.
 IRC: Added the ability to send NOTICES.
 IRC: !status/!help can both be sent to the bot in channel now and it will respond appropriately.
 IRC: Added a check to see if the IRC Bot is actually enabled and online before sending a notification that it IS online.
 Drawing-related state is now reset when changing worlds.
 Added a limiter to the number of block updates that can be processed per tick (even if there are no players in a world). Fixes server becoming unresponsive when doing enormous drawing commands (millions of blocks).

0.401
 *IDLE/AFK CHECKING* This is configurable per-class.
 Added /version command, and added revision to the version string.

 IRC Bot will now handle terminations by the IRCd and restart itself upon any errors. 
 IRC Bot can now send from inside the server TO IRC! Use the prefix '#' in-game to send any message to IRC. Forwarding all server chat may be added if requested. To send from the bot to the server, use the bot's nickname and either ':', ',' or nothing, then your message.
 Improved performance of the IRC bot and the task scheduler.
 Fixed a bug with getting the server url from the externalurl.txt file crashing the IRC MessageHandler() when the file didn't exist. FORWARD_ALL is now enabled for both SERVER and IRC for 100% transparent chatting.
 Fixed a bug in the server-to-irc code that forwarded a blank message if there was nothing after '#' in server chat.
 Handshake packet is now written when doing /join, to replace MOTD with a more informative "Now loading [worldname]".


0.400
 *MULTIWORLD*. It's finally here. See /help for information on new commands: /worlds, /wload, /join
 Added a persistent world list, saved in worlds.txt - this is subject to change. The file contains a list of world names, each corresponding to an .fcm file. The first world listed at the top of worlds.txt is the default/main one.
 *IRC BOT*. Thanks to the efforts by Destroyer661, fCraft now has an optional IRC bot for relaying chat and commands.
 A field has been added in the config to allow forwarding ALL IRC CHANNEL TRAFFIC to the server. This will override the prefix and make it inactive. 'IRCBotForwardAll' is set to false by default.
 *ZONES*. It is now possible to make guest zones and op zones (and anything in-between) on any map. See /help for information on new commands: /zones, /zone, /zremove.
