## To create a custom config for a mod create a file with the same name
## as the jar file and append ".conf", for craftbukkit this would be
## "craftbukkit.jar.conf".
## The following config is an example that lists all possible options,
## without actually changing anything (it remaps the commands on
## themselves)
##
## General configuration. If this contains a setting called "file" the
## [commands], [start] and [parse_*] sections will be loaded from this
## other file
[config]
## The name as displayed in the panel, leave empty to hide
name = Craftbukkit: Recommended 1.6.2-R1.0
## Where to download the JAR file from
source = http://cbukk.it/craftbukkit.jar
## Where to download this file from (will overwrite this file with the downloaded one)
configSource = http://www.multicraft.org/download/conf/?file=craftbukkit.jar.conf
## Sections of this file that may be overridden by .conf files in the server directory
#safeConfSections = ^(encoding|commands|parse_.+)$

## Encoding used for strings sent to and received from the server
[encoding]
## The encoding to use to send data to the Minecraft process
## Use "system" for your current locale.
## default: system
encode = system
## The encoding to use to decode data received from the Minecraft process
## Use "system" for your current locale.
## default: system
decode = system
## The encoding used when reading/writing configuration files such as
## the server.properties
## default: latin-1
fileEncoding = latin-1
