TeamSpeak 3 Server - Quickstart Guide
=====================================

Copyright (c) TeamSpeak Systems GmbH

-----------------------
(1) System requirements
-----------------------

(i) Windows
Windows 2000, XP, 2003, 2003 R2, 2008, Vista, 7 and 2008 R2. Both 32bit and 64bit 
are natively supported.

(ii) Linux
A reasonably modern Linux environment with libstdc++ 6 is required. Both 32bit
and 64bit are natively supported. In addition, TeamSpeak 3 requires the epoll 
API which was introduced in Linux kernel 2.5.44. Support was added to glibc 
in version 2.3.2.

(iii) Mac OS X
Mac OS X 10.3.9 or better on Macs with Intel or PowerPC processors.

(2) Installation
----------------

(i) Windows

Download the correct file for your architecture:
 - teamspeak3-server_win32.zip for 32bit Windows
 - teamspeak3-server_win64.zip for 64bit Windows

We recommend running the TeamSpeak 3 Server from the command shell. Extract the 
archive in a directory of your choice. Open the command shell and change path to 
this directory. From here you can start the server executable.

Example (32bit):
 $ cd C:\ts3server\teamspeak3-server_win32
 $ ts3server_win32.exe

Example (64bit):
 $ cd C:\ts3server\teamspeak3-server_win64
 $ ts3server_win64.exe

(ii) Linux

Download the correct file for your architecture:
 - teamspeak3-server-linux_x86.tar.gz for 32bit Linux
 - teamspeak3-server-linux_amd64.tar.gz for 64bit Linux

Extract the archive in a directory of your choice and run the TeamSpeak 3 Server 
binary.

Example (On Screen):
$ tar xzf teamspeak3-server-linux_x86.tar.gz
$ cd teamspeak3-server-linux_x86
$ ./ts3server_minimal_runscript.sh

Example (Background):
$ tar xzf teamspeak3-server-linux_x86.tar.gz
$ cd teamspeak3-server-linux_x86
$ ./ts3server_startscript.sh

*** ATTENTION ***

In some cases, the server process terminates on startup and the error message reads 
"Server() error while starting servermanager, error: instance check error".

As long as you don't have a license key embededded we make sure you only run exactly 
one instance of the TS3 server free unregistered version. We use shared memory to 
facilitate the communication to detect other running instances, which requires tmpfs 
to be mounted at /dev/shm. If you (for whatever reason) do not have this mounted, the 
above error will occur.

To fix this problem, the following commands or file edits need to be done as root user 
(or using something like sudo). This is a temporary fix until your next reboot.

 mount -t tmpfs tmpfs /dev/shm

Now, to make sure this mount is done automatically upon reboot edit the file /etc/fstab 
and add the line:

 tmpfs /dev/shm tmpfs defaults 0 0

(iii) Mac OS X

Download the file teamspeak3-server-mac.zip, which includes an universal
binary running on both Intel and PowerPC Macintosh computers. Copy the archive 
into a directory of your choice and extract it using Finder or the Terminal 
application.

$ unzip teamspeak3-server_mac.zip
$ cd teamspeak3-server_mac
$ ./ts3server_mac

----------------
(3) License File
----------------

To run a TeamSpeak 3 Server instance with more than a single virtual server
and 32 slots you require a license file. The license can be obtained here:

https://sales.teamspeakusa.com/

Without a proper license file available the server will refuse to start or 
fallback to limited functionality. Once the license file is available, copy 
it into the TeamSpeak 3 Server directory, where the server executable is located.

-----------------------------
(4) Server Output and Logfile
-----------------------------

On Linux and Mac OS X the server will print its log output to the console in
which you started it. In addition the log output is written into several files,
located in the logs/ subdirectory.

*** NOTE ***

On Windows, the server will only write the logfile, there is no console output.

-------------------
(5) Virtual Servers
-------------------

Like with TeamSpeak 2, the server process serves as a container for multiple
virtual servers running within the same process. When the server process is
started, one virtual voice server will be automatically created unless the
"create_default_virtualserver=0" commandline parameter is specified.

The first virtual server will be running on port 9987 by default. Subsequently
started virtual servers will be running on increasing port numbers. The second
on 9998, the third on 9999 etc. The first default port can be changed by 
specifying the "default_voice_port=<port>" commandline parameter.

Virtual servers are always unique, marked by an unique identifier. Hence it is
not possible to start the same virtual server within a second server process.

--------------------------
(6) Commandline Parameters
--------------------------

Commandline parameters are passed to the TeamSpeak 3 Server using the form:

ts3server_<arch> <parameter1>=<value1> [<parameter2>=<value2>] ...

Important: All commandline parameters passed to the server need to be escaped
using the ServerQuery escape patterns (check the ServerQuery manual for details).

Example:
$ ./ts3server_minimal_runscript.sh clear_database=1 create_default_virtualserver=0

Commandline parameters are not saved over sessions, so if you passed paramaters
when starting the server process, you need to pass them again the next time. If
a parameter is not specified, the default value will be used, regardless of
parameters specified during a previous server start.

The following commandline parameters are available:

* default_voice_port (9987)
  UDP port open for clients to connect to. This port is used by the first 
  virtual server, subsequently started virtual servers will open on increasing 
  port numbers.
  Default: The default voice port is 9987.

* voice_ip (0.0.0.0)
  IP on which the server instance will listen for incoming voice connections.
  Default: The server is bound on any IP address.

* create_default_virtualserver (1)
  Normally one virtual server is created automatically when the TeamSpeak 3
  Server process is started. To disable this behaviour, set this parameter
  to "0". In this case you have to start virtual servers manually using the
  ServerQuery interface.
  Default: If not provided, one virtual server is created.

* machine_id (<empty>)
  Optional name of this server process to identify a group of servers with
  the same ID. This can be useful when running multiple TeamSpeak 3 Server
  instances on the same database. Please note that we strongly recommend that
  you do NOT run multiple server instances on the same SQLite database.
  Default: The server instance will not use a machine ID.

* filetransfer_port (30033)
  TCP Port opened for file transfers. If you specify this parameter, you also 
  need to specify the "filetransfer_ip" parameter!
  Default: The default file tranfer port is 30033.
  
* filetransfer_ip (0.0.0.0)
  IP on which the file transfers are bound to. If you specify this parameter, 
  you also need to specify the "filetransfer_port" parameter!
  Default: File transfers are bound on any IP address.

* query_port (10011)
  TCP Port opened for ServerQuery connections. If you specify this parameter, 
  need to specify the "query_ip" parameter!
  Default: The default ServerQuery port is 10011.

* query_ip (0.0.0.0)
  IP bound for incoming ServerQuery connections. If you specify this parameter, 
  you also need to specify the "query_port" parameter!
  Default: ServerQuery connections are bound on any IP address.

* clear_database (0)
  If set to "1", the server database will be cleared before starting up the server. 
  This is mainly used for testing. Usually this parameter should not be specified, 
  so all server settings will be restored when the server process is restarted.
  Default: Database is not cleared on start.

* logpath (logs/)
  The physical path where the server will create logfiles.
  Default: The server will create logfiles in the "logs/" subdirectory.

* dbplugin (ts3db_sqlite3)
  Name of the database plugin library used by the server instance. For example, if
  you want to start the server with MySQL support, simply set this parameter to
  "ts3db_mysql" to use the MySQL plugin. Do *NOT* specify the "lib" prefix or the file 
  extension of the plugin.
  Default: The default SQLite3 database plugin will be used.
  
* dbpluginparameter (<empty>)
  A custom parameter passed to the database plugin library. For example, the MySQL
  database plugin supports a parameter to specify the physical path of the plugins
  configuration file.
  Default: The database plugin will be used without a parameter.

* dbsqlpath (sql/)
  The physical path where your SQL script files are located.
  Default: The server will search for SQL script files in the "sql/" subdirectory.

* dbsqlcreatepath (create_sqlite/)
  The physical path where your SQL installation files are located. Note that this 
  path will be added to the value of the "dbsqlpath" parameter.
  Default: The server will search for SQL installation scripts files in the 
  "<dbsqlpath>/dbsqlcreatepath/" subdirectory.
  
* licensepath (<empty>)
  The physical path where your license file is located.
  Default: The license file is located in your servers installation directory.
  
* createinifile (0)
  If set to "1", the server will create an INI-style config file containing all 
  commandline parameters with the values you have specified.
  Default: The server will not create a config file.
  
* inifile (ts3server.ini)
  The physical path where your config file is located. Per default, the config file will
  be called "ts3server.ini".
  Default: The config file is located in your servers installation directory.
  
* query_ip_whitelist (query_ip_whitelist.txt)
  The file containing whitelisted IP addresses for the ServerQuery interface. All hosts
  listed in this file will be ignored by the ServerQuery flood protection.
  Default: The whitelist file is located in your servers installation directory.
  
* query_ip_backlist (query_ip_backlist.txt)
  The file containing backlisted IP addresses for the ServerQuery interface. All hosts
  listed in this file are not allowed to connect to the ServerQuery interface.
  Default: The whitelist file is located in your servers installation directory.

* dbclientkeepdays (90)
  Defines how many days to keep unused client identities. Auto-pruning is triggered on every 
  start and on every new month while the server is running.
  Default: The server will auto-prune client identities older than 90 days.
    
* logquerycommands (1)
  If set to "1", the server will log every ServerQuery command executed by clients. This can
  be useful while trying to diagnose several different issues.
  Default: ServerQuery commands will not be logged.
  
* no_permission_update (0)
  If set to "1", new permissions will not be added to existing groups automatically. Note that
  this can break your server configuration if you dont update them manually.
  Default: New permissions will be added to existing groups automatically.

* open_win_console (0)
  If set to "1", the server will open a console window. Note that this only affects Windows 
  servers.
  Default: The console will be hidden on Windows.

* no_password_dialog (0)
  If set to "1", the server will not display the initial password dialog on the first start. 
  Note that this only affects Windows servers.
  Default: The initial password dialog will be shown.
  
* dbconnections (10)
  The number of database connections used by the server. Please note that changing this value
  can have an affect on your servers performance. Possible values are 2-100.
  Default: The server will use 10 database connections.
  
* logappend (0)
  If set to "1", the server will not create a new logfile on every start. Instead, the log
  output will be appended to the previous logfile. The logfile name will only contain the
  ID of the virtual server.
  Default: The server will create a new logfile on every start.

------------------------------------
(7) Using Alternate Database Plugins
------------------------------------

(i) MySQL plugin

To make your TeamSpeak 3 Server use a MySQL database you need to make sure that the
"ts3db_mysql" library is located in your servers installation directory. Per default,
the plugin is using the following parameters:

* host (127.0.0.1)
  The hostname or IP addresss of your MySQL server.

* port (3306)
  The TCP port of your MySQL server.
  
* username (root)
  The username used to authenticate with your MySQL server.

* password (<empty>)
  The password used to authenticate with your MySQL server.

* database (test)
  The name of a database on your MySQL server. Note that this database must be created
  before the TeamSpeak 3 Server is started.
  
* socket (<empty>)
  The name of the Unix socket file to use, for connections made via a named pipe to a 
  local server.
  
All parameters can be customized by creating a INI-style configuration file called 
"ts3db_mysql.ini". For example:

[config]
host=localhost
port=3306
username=teamspeak
password=x5gUjs
database=ts3db
socket=

The path and filename of the configuration file can be set using the "dbpluginparameter"
commandline parameter.

To start the TeamSpeak 3 Server with MySQL support, you need to specify the "dbplugin"
commandline parameter. You may also need to specify the "dbsqlcreatepath" parameter if
you're starting the server instance for the first time since the syntax of the MySQL
installation files differs from SQLite3.

Example:
$ ./ts3server_linux_amd64 dbplugin=ts3db_mysql dbsqlcreatepath=create_mysql/

-------------------------------
(8) Gaining Adminstrator Access
-------------------------------

(i) Regular clients

The first time a virtual server is created, a server administrator token will
be automatically created in the server log with the following form:

--------------------------------------------------------
ServerAdmin token created, please use the line below
token=ppEa0Wp6hopKBzKhH5RiUtb5Ggve5aI8J7ifu+/P
--------------------------------------------------------

This token can be used in the TeamSpeak 3 Client to gain administrator permissions 
for the currently logged in client. A token can only be used *ONCE*.

The server log is written to a file in the logs subdirectory. On Linux and Mac OS X 
it is also printed to the console from which the server was started.

(ii) ServerQuery clients

To gain global administration permissions for ServerQuery access, the first time 
the server instance is started a ServerQuery password is printed to the console 
output:

------------------------------------------------------------------
                      I M P O R T A N T
------------------------------------------------------------------
              Server Query Admin Acccount created
         loginname= "serveradmin", password= "BAIPwM8X"
------------------------------------------------------------------

Use the provided login name and password to access the server using the ServerQuery 
interface.

Note: The ServerQuery password is only shown *ONCE* when the server is started for 
the first time, so make sure you save this information for future reference. The only 
way to generate a new token and password would be to delete the server database by 
starting server with the "clear_database=1" commandline paramater or deleting the file 
ts3server.sqlitedb. In this case all server settings and user accounts would be lost.

-----------------------------------------------
(9) Understandng the Status of a Virtual Server 
-----------------------------------------------

The status of a virtual server can be:

* online
  The virtual server is running and clients can connect
  
* offline
  The virtual server is not running
  
* booting up
  The virtual server is currently starting
  
* shutting down
  The virtual server is currently shutting down
  
* deploy running
  The virtual server is currently deploying a snapshot
  
* virtual online
  The virtual server is running *isolated* and clients cannot connect
  
* other instance
  The virtual server is running in another TeamSpeak 3 instance

Whenever you select a virtual server which is currently stopped, it will be started in 
virtual mode which means you are able to change its configuration, create channels or 
change permissions, but no regular TeamSpeak 3 Client can connect. As soon as the last 
ServerQuery client deselects the virtual server (command: "use 0") or closes connection, 
its status will be changed back to "offline".

*** IMPORTANT ***

Changing a virtual servers status from "virtual online" to "offline" is an asynchronous 
operation so it is possible that a virtual server will still be in the process of shutting 
down when you try to start it right after deselcting it.
